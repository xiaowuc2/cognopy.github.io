## Abstract 

Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) research has grown significantly in recent
years. A number of software offerings now exist that provide stable, comprehensive implementations for benchmarking. At the same time, recent deep RL research has become more diverse in its goals. In this paper we introduce Dopamine,
a new research framework for deep RL that aims to support some of that diversity.
Dopamine is open-source, TensorFlow-based, and provides compact and reliable
implementations of some state-of-the-art deep RL agents. We complement this
offering with a taxonomy of the different research objectives in deep RL research.
While by no means exhaustive, our analysis highlights the heterogeneity of research in the field, and the value of frameworks such as ours. ï£¿
